# EEG_Toolbox_v13
Welcome to the EEG Toolbox_v13


about:

EEG Toolbox v13 is a tool for rising and checking of different scientific hypothesis in the field of neuroscience

propose & scope:

The EEG Toolbox is a collection of MatLab functions
The main goals of the toolbox are:
	Processing and analysis of EEG signals
	Rising and checking different computational hypothesis
The Toolbox covers the following computational areas with minimum overlap to the existing Toolboxes in the field :  
	Preprocessing EEG signals
	Analysis of EEG signals in Time - Frequency domain
	Reconstruction of Functional connectivity
	Network analysis
	Surrogate Networks generation
	Mathematical Models & Network Models simulations

testing and using:

To test the toolbox, do the following steps:

- add the directory "Toolbox_v13" with its subdirectories to your matlab path;

- enter the "Toolbox_v13" directory;

- read the file "Toolbox Functions list.docx";

- start MatLab(R);

- navigate to the directory "Toolbox_v13";

- start the file "Live_Script-test_toolbox_13.mlx"


You may need to add new functions/scripts or change the existing...

Simply keep me posted for the changes you did...

Have fun
